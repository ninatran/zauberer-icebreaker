Tommy started his day as he always did, pulling on his traditonal Dirndel--Lederhosen and cowboy boots--before climbing into his 1999 BMW and driving to his favorite Ratskeller Raesfeld.
After turning off the Hauptstrasse, Tommy parked his BMW next to Nina's Porsche, they were meeting each other at the bar because their favorite band Rammstein was playing Musik tonight.
Before going to the concert they decided to stop by the Biergarten. That was when they saw a familiar face getting out of an Audi.
"Jonah?! Is that really you? I haven't heard from you since you tried to hold up the Flughafen in Munich with a Bratwurst!," Tommy exclaimed.
"A Bratwurst!? you say... no! no! no! I used a Brot not a Bratwurst, you must have misheard." Jonah says with a confident tone.
Tommy was in shock and could not believe what he had heard, however a Hund was nearby and barked right into Tommy's ear, awaking Tommy from his state of shock.
