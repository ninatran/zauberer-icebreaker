Tommy started his day as he always did, pulling on his traditonal Dirndel--Lederhosen and cowboy boots--before climbing into his 1999 BMW and driving to his favorite Ratskeller Raesfeld.
After turning off the Hauptstrasse -- main road --, Tommy parked his BMW next to Nina's Porsche, they were meeting each other at the bar because their favorite band Rammstein was playing musik --music-- tonight.
